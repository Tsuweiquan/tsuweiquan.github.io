I am a [Passionate](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnaWnrzTXCpNntQhbBipZp8CiVgXx0FM4?si=X2zsVDnQkJ1qy74n) Computer Engineer with a strong interest in Cloud Computing and Fintech.

As a techie, my interests lie in infrastructure, networking, and programming, with an aspiration to become a little better every day, even if it's just a bit.

Today, I live by this phrase: `Progress beats perfection. Stop thinking and start doing`. It was derived from this [video](https://youtu.be/og2unLDWNHg?si=gpYeoJew04LC7y6a), but of course, I want to be more than just a tool ðŸª›.

In 2024, I realized that I had been overthinking quite a bit, which ultimately killed the ideas that I had. Overthinking caused me to make safe decisions and lose out on opportunities. Moving forward in life, I want to improve myself and strive to be a better person, starting with continuous learning and self-improvement to gain more knowledge!

Besides tech-related stuff, I also love to travel and experience different cultures, food, and life. I look forward to visiting China, Japan, Paris, Greenland, the United States, and Korea soon.
