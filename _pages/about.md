I am Passionate Computer Engineer with a strong interest in Cloud Computing and Fintech.

As a techie, my interests lie in infrastructure, networking, and programming, with an aspiration to become a little better everyday, even if it's just a bit.

Today, I live on this phrase `"Progress beats perfection. Stop thinking and start doing`. It was derived from this [video](https://youtu.be/og2unLDWNHg?si=gpYeoJew04LC7y6a) but of course, be more than just a tool ðŸª›.

In 2024, I realized that I had been overthinking quite a bit, which ultimately killed the ideas that I had. Overthinking caused me to make safe decisions and lose out on opportunities.

Moving forward in life, I want to improve myself and try to be a better person. Starting with continuous learning and self-improvement to gain more knowledge! These are some goals I have set for myself:

1. I must acquire certifications such as Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
2. I must complete my Udemy course on Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Analysis and create a system to execute smart trades for me
3. Update my GitHub pages with at least 6 technical blog posts
4. Educate myself in the machine learning space

Other than techie boring stuff, I also love to travel and experience different cultures, food, and life. I look forward to visiting China, Japan, Paris, Greenland, the United States, and Korea soon!
